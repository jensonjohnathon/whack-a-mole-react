Whack a mole game I created to hammer in the concepts talked about in the React Docs Tic Tac Toe Game.
To finalise the Game Styling and a Timer component could be added. When the Timer runs out the Game ends and the Score (if higher) may be saved as a High Score. Styling could be done in two ways, make the buttons Images, or keep letters as buttons to keep the spirit of the original Tic Tac Toe Game either way the rest will have to be tidyed up as well.
